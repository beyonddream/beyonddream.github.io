## Thesis

This article attemps to articulate a mysterious feeling that I usually have when automating mundane tasks using small scripts - usually written in dynamic languages like perl/javascript/python. The joy of seeing your creation taking shape and doing your bidding is unimaginable but not beyond experienceable. The moment you get an immediate feedback from successfully running a script, you are locked in and it is hard to let go of the flow.

## Case Study

In order to illustrate my points, I will use many small utility tools I wrote as specimen, explaining the motivation for its existence and how and why it was fun but more importantly to put on notice a feeling akin to romanticism intermixed with a sense of pleasing the Other.
