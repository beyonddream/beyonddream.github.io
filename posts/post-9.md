## Introduction

It is a well known fact that most software engineers are opiniated bunch and like to argue. But often their arguments exhibit certain biases and logical fallacies. They are also prone to errors in thinking due to some bias inherent in their recollection of the past. I was recently reading a book about this topic and was motivated to document some of them here for my own future self. They are by no means exhaustive but very much indicative of those I am aware of as a practicing software engineer.

## Appeal to authority

You are arguing for a design not because you have evaluated all the pros/cons using some prototype implementation with relevant metrics to prove your point but rather depend on another authority figure either in your company or in your field, as a justification in and of itself (unrelated to the matter at hand) to find acceptance for your proposal.

An example: “I want to use PHP in my new project. If it is good enough for facebook then it will be good enough for us.”
